# MTL-XF-030 — Required deliverables

**Commissioned decision:** Which English river water bodies warrant further environmental investigation based on ecological/chemical classifications and recorded measures, with cycle comparability and evidence gaps made explicit?

All locations below refer to the team's delivery repository. The master repository defines the requirements and contains no completed analysis. Owners are assigned from [the project roles](PROJECT_BRIEF.md).

## D1 — Discovery & decision requirements

**Due:** Week 1  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/01-discovery/`

Decision statement; stakeholder map; as-is reporting to investigation-review process; at least eight prioritised requirements. Answer these questions: Which river water bodies have the weakest ecological or chemical status in a comparable assessment cycle? Which apparent changes may reflect methodology rather than environmental change? Where are recorded measures linked to weaker classifications? Which bodies have missing classification or measure evidence? Which cases require field sampling, pressure assessment or delivery-status investigation?

**Acceptance evidence:** All requirements have an owner, priority, deliverable and test ID; domain analyst approves scope.

## D2 — Governed sources & cohort

**Due:** Week 2  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/02-data-governance/; data/`

Use the agreed Environment Agency England classifications.csv and measures.csv endpoints. They are mutable exports: freeze both at one recorded retrieval timestamp before team analysis. Filter to England river water bodies using actual type codes; include other water-body types only as separately labelled context. Compare classification years/cycles only when methodologically compatible. No raw Water Quality Explorer observations are required. Register exact files, metadata, licences, checksums, coverage and critical fields; record rejection of unavailable dimensions.

**Acceptance evidence:** 100% of inputs registered; no claimed freeze until acquisition evidence exists.

## D3 — Reproducible analytical model

**Due:** Week 3  
**Team artefact location:** `src/; sql/; docs/03-data-model/`

Classification fact: water-body identifier × year/cycle × classification level/element × status and other published dimensions. Measures fact: published measure identifier × water-body/catchment links × status/category. Link using stable identifiers with a bridge for many-to-many relationships. Deliver load, type checks, hierarchy handling, lineage, exclusions and environment instructions.

**Acceptance evidence:** A second member regenerates equivalent curated outputs from identical inputs; no unexplained duplicate analytical keys.

## D4 — Quality & reconciliation

**Due:** Week 3  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/04-data-quality/; tests/`

Profile missingness, suppression, valid values, keys and join coverage. Reconcile distinct-body status counts for five selected classifications/catchments. Show a multi-measure join cannot inflate the count of water bodies. Reject a cross-cycle deterioration comparison lacking comparability evidence. Test unknown status, an unmatched body ID and a non-river exclusion.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every input row is accounted for as retained, excluded or quarantined; five published cells reconcile within declared rounding.

## D5 — KPI catalogue

**Due:** Week 4  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/05-kpi-catalogue/`

Define all 8 measures listed below with formula, grain, denominator, unit, source fields, exclusions, owner, refresh and limitations.

**Acceptance evidence:** 100% headline metrics trace to source fields and tested transformations; conditional unavailable measures are explicitly marked.

## D6 — Domain analytical assessment

**Due:** Week 5  
**Team artefact location:** `analysis/; docs/06-analysis/`

Create a river-only classification baseline by compatible cycle, keeping ecological and chemical outcomes separate. Assess change only where comparability is evidenced; otherwise deliver a single-cycle baseline and a documented comparability rejection.

**Acceptance evidence:** At least five evidence-backed findings state period, population, comparison, magnitude, uncertainty and limitation; negative findings count.

## D7 — Investigation decision framework

**Due:** Week 6  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/07-decision-framework/`

Shortlist up to ten water bodies for investigation using classification weakness, missingness and recorded-measure context; test at least two classification/missingness priority rules. Record eligibility, thresholds, weights if used, reason codes and manual review triggers.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every shortlisted case has metrics, rationale, owner and evidence gaps; at least two scenarios compared; fewer than ten is valid where evidence is insufficient.

## D8 — BI decision-support product

**Due:** Draft Week 6; final Week 7  
**Team artefact location:** `dashboard/`

Executive overview answering 'Which English river water bodies warrant further environmental investigation based on ecological/chemical classifications and recorded measures, with cycle comparability and evidence gaps made explicit?' plus diagnostic and data-quality views; visible periods, units, denominator notes, resettable filters and accessible labels.

**Acceptance evidence:** Five headline measures reconcile; every filter tested; export screenshots/PDF plus reproducible build or free access instructions.

## D9 — Independent assurance & UAT

**Due:** Week 7  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/08-assurance-uat/`

At least ten scenarios including the four project-specific tests below; requirement-to-test matrix, expected/actual evidence, defect log and simulated stakeholder feedback.

**Acceptance evidence:** No unresolved critical/high defect; accepted lower-severity limitations have a named reviewer and explicit impact.

## D10 — Technical & operational handover

**Due:** Week 8  
**Team artefact location:** `docs/09-technical-handover/`

Clean setup, architecture, frozen input manifest, run/refresh steps, output checks, troubleshooting and change-control process for River Water Quality Classification & Environmental Intervention Intelligence.

**Acceptance evidence:** Another member reproduces the core outputs without undocumented edits and records environment, duration and discrepancies.

## D11 — Executive recommendation

**Due:** Week 8  
**Team artefact location:** `deliverables/`

Maximum two-page briefing and 15–20 minute presentation: commissioned decision, five findings, investigation shortlist, sensitivity, missing evidence, responsibilities and next review.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every quantitative claim links to an artefact/metric; no unsupported causal, policy or operational guarantee.

## D12 — Contribution & delivery record

**Due:** Weekly; final Week 8  
**Team artefact location:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md; delivery issues/PRs`

Record who delivered and reviewed each MTL-XF-030 work package, including domain, governance, engineering, BI and assurance contributions.

**Acceptance evidence:** Every member links to substantive artefacts and review/presentation evidence; commit count alone is insufficient.

## Required KPI definitions

| Metric | Required definition / calculation |
| --- | --- |
| Ecological status distribution | Distinct eligible water bodies by published ecological status within one assessment year/cycle. |
| Good-or-better ecological share | 100 × eligible bodies with good/high ecological status / bodies with valid comparable ecological status. |
| Chemical status distribution | Distinct bodies by chemical status, kept separate from ecological status. |
| Comparable deterioration count | Bodies moving to a worse ordered ecological class between compatible cycles; chemical status uses its own rules. |
| Recorded measure coverage | 100 × eligible bodies linked to at least one recorded measure / eligible bodies; no effectiveness claim. |
| Measure status distribution | Distinct measures by available published implementation/status categories; preserve unknowns. |
| Classification completeness | 100 × bodies with valid target classification / expected eligible bodies. |
| Join coverage | Matched distinct water bodies / eligible bodies, plus unmatched and multiply linked measure counts. |

For every metric record business purpose, formula, source fields, grain, unit, numerator/denominator, exclusions, suppression, zero-base behaviour, owner, refresh and test evidence. Do not populate conditional metrics from invented fields.

## Mandatory domain scenarios

1. Reconcile distinct-body status counts for five selected classifications/catchments.
2. Show a multi-measure join cannot inflate the count of water bodies.
3. Reject a cross-cycle deterioration comparison lacking comparability evidence.
4. Test unknown status, an unmatched body ID and a non-river exclusion.

## Review gates

Week 2: cohort and source approval. Week 4: model, DQ and metrics approval. Week 6: analytical and decision-framework review. Week 8: UAT, independent rerun and final panel review. Record reviewer, date, artefact version and decision at every gate.
