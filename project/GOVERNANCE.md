# MTL-XF-030 — Governance and decision controls

This is a **simulated confidential-client engagement using official public/open data**. Client and stakeholder role labels describe a fictional engagement; do not claim a real external Mettelo customer, employment, endorsement or privileged data access. No raw data is uploaded by this specification update.

## Authority and accountability

**Director of Catchment Environment & River Improvement** owns business scope, prioritisation assumptions, accepted analytical limitations and investigation recommendations. The Mettelo review panel owns programme acceptance. Operational responsibilities are in [business context](BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md); delivery-role artefacts are in [the project brief](PROJECT_BRIEF.md).

The Data Governance Analyst approves source identity, metadata, licence evidence and field support. The Data Engineer owns transformations and reruns. Domain specialists approve interpretation; a distinct reviewer checks critical calculations and executes or reviews DT1–DT10. Combining delivery roles does not remove review accountability.

## Stage gates

| Gate | Accountability | Required review |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 — scope/source, end Week 2 | Business Analyst + Data Governance Analyst + domain specialist | Approve actual period, geography, grain, required input and field support in a source-to-deliverable matrix. Classification/methodology pages and endpoint documentation verified; export schema, actual cycle, body-type filter, measure-link grain and checksums pending. Unsupported mandatory outputs remain blocked, not quietly reclassified as completed. |
| G2 — model/metrics, end Week 4 | Data Engineer + domain specialist + independent reviewer | Approve row accounting, keys, hierarchy, join cardinality, five source reconciliations and all core metric definitions. |
| G3 — analytical decision review, end Week 6 | Director of Catchment Environment & River Improvement + operational stakeholders | First compare an ecological-status-led queue with an evidence-gap-led queue within the same eligible body set. Preserve status/potential distinctions for modified/artificial bodies. Do not use an all-fail chemical status as if it independently differentiates priority. Catchment-level measures must not be attributed to every body as a proven body-level intervention. Retain an evidence-insufficient case and a manual review route. |
| G4 — release, end Week 8 | Simulated Mettelo panel + independent reviewer | Accept D1–D12 only after ten executed domain tests, five BI reconciliations, clean rerun evidence and resolution of all critical/high defects. |

## Data/source control

Use the [source register](../data/SOURCE_REGISTER.md) as the authoritative evidence record. Preserve agreed URLs and explicitly label new required references, supplements and fallbacks. Record each actual file's resolved URL, retrieval UTC, release, scope, bytes, checksum and licence notices. Public access alone is not proof of unrestricted redistribution. No raw-data upload is part of this update.

Freeze input files only after the source-to-deliverable matrix passes; retain original bytes in an approved location and never overwrite a snapshot. A fallback must have a documented activation reason, compatible coverage and version-selection rule. Do not stack overlapping combined and fallback inputs.

## Domain interpretation

- Measures recorded in an administrative dataset do not prove implementation or ecological effectiveness.
- Do not average ordinal status labels into a continuous pollution score or combine chemical and ecological scales.
- Classification changes can reflect monitoring and method changes; these files do not supply raw chemical sampling histories.

**Primary risk:** Cross-cycle methods, repeated elements and many-to-many measure linkage may create false deterioration, body counts or intervention coverage.

The [metric contract](DELIVERABLES.md) and [domain tests](ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) govern calculations. Thresholds/weights that are project choices must be labelled as such, with baseline and alternative scenarios; they are not official service standards. No automatic allocation or regulatory/professional certification is implied.

## Core and extension change control

Cross-cycle deterioration, raw nutrient time series, causal measure effectiveness and a GIS map needing an additional boundary file are extensions. Cross-cycle change is blocked unless a comparability assessment explicitly passes; a valid single-cycle baseline fully satisfies core delivery.

Every source/scope change records requester, date, reason, old/new requirement, coverage/schema impact, affected KPIs/artefacts/tests, owner, reviewer and decision. Missing mandatory evidence blocks the dependent release; it is not resolved by relabelling a promised deliverable unavailable. Optional models need a naive baseline, appropriate holdout, leakage checks, uncertainty and a named reviewer.

## Reuse, information and repository controls

Never commit secrets, private correspondence or unnecessary personal details. Preserve suppression and publication notices. Check screenshots and exports for permitted publication. The team repository must be under Mettelo with individual member accounts, evidence-linked contributions and reviews. Record environment, manifest and final commit/tag so reviewers can reproduce results without paid-only access. Accurately describe verified participation; do not claim real-client employment, endorsement, operational adoption or achieved savings.
